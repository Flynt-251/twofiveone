# HI. I'M FINN.

I'm a computer science student, an executive committee member for a student society, and a tech nerd.

## Study

I'm currently studying at the University of Warwick, for an Integrated Masters degree in Computer Science. I've done work in a range of languages, including Python, Java, Haskell, C, and much more.
My work is focussed on software engineering, but I also have interest in the Sociology of the Internet, discovering the effects of the Internet on people's lives and recent trends on the dissemination of information.
One of my most recent projects was writing an essay in which I compiled research about Vaccine Misinformation, focussing on groups on X (formerly Twitter) and how they flood networks with misinformation to facilitate its spread and potential to "go viral".

## Involvement in the Student Community

I work with the University of Warwick Computing Society, or [UWCS](https://uwcs.co.uk) for short, as a Gaming Coordinator. I work with other members of its executive committee to deliver regular gaming events to Warwick's student community, including our weekly Friday Night Gaming and our termly LAN parties that last an entire weekend!
However, gaming events are not the only thing I work on, as I'm also helping with Warwick's upcoming hackathon, known as WHACK, alongside other social and academic events hosted by UWCS.

Along with my work in UWCS, I've also worked as a mentor in Warwick Coding Society, teaching Python to other students who learn programming as part of their course.

## Tech

I also collect a lot of nifty tech! In particular, I'm interested in PC building, and have built my own rig (and have worked on others). I also like repurposing and refurbishing older tech in the hopes that it can be reused moving forward. I typically post about this sort of stuff on my blog, and will do my best to link to the resources I use in case you want to replicate anything you see (but I'm hardly a professional, always follow trusted guides!).

## Socials

You can find me on most platforms as Flynt or Flynt251. If you're interested in the work I've done (and what I'm doing with UWCS), you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/flynt-251)!

Alternatively, you can send me an email at [finn.mcgoldrick@twofiveone.xyz](mailto:finn.mcgoldrick@twofiveone.xyz).
